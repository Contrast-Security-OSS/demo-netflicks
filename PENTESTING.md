# Penetration testing with Contrast Assess

Contrast Assess is a powerful tool for finding vulnerabilities in your applications. It is a runtime security tool, finding vulnerabilities in applications by directly observing applications and how they behave whilst handling real-world requests. 

Contrast Assess can be used to augment a penetration test, providing insights and telemetry from within the application as you perform your usual penetration testing activities. 

### Benefits of using Contrast during a penetration test
* Contrast immediately discovers the attack surface and available code routes and endpoints within an application on startup. 
* Contrast keeps track of where you've tested and where you haven't.
* Contrast does not require exploitation to find vulnerabilities, just normal requests, either triggered manually or by test suites. 
* Contrast is great at finding input based vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, XXE, and many more, freeing you up to focus on business logic based vulnerabilities.
* Contrast provides detailed information about vulnerabilities so you can focus on building your POCs and exploits. 

## Getting started

1. **Download a configuration file from the contrast dashboard:** Log into the Contrast platform, select `Add new` in the top menu bar, and then select `Application`. Select `.NET Core` from the dropdown in step 1, and then `Download the .NET Core contrast_security.yaml` in step 2. Place this file in the root of this repo. 

2. **Start the application with contrast enabled**
 
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

3. **Start BurpSuite and install the Contrast BurpTrast extension**
4. **Log in to Contrast in the BurpTrast extention and select your organization and the target applicaton.**
5. **Turn on live view and browse the application.** 

6. Have fun pentesting!

### Other things to try: 

1. Try running integration tests or end-to-end tests against the application. Contrast will observe the requests and responses and find vulnerabilities.
   ```bash
   npm run tests
   ```
